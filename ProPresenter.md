## Editing/Formatting Songs


### Song Structure

- All verses and variations of verses should be included in the master arrangement of the song including other language/translated verses
- If the song has a repeating part such as a chorus or bridge it should only appear once in the master.
- All songs should have a new arrangement called `Main` where all repeated sections like choruses are placed into their spots.
- All slides more than 4 lines long should be broken into 2 separate slides. The second slide does not get a group and should be automatically connected to the previous.

#### Main Arrangement Details
- All the verses/choruses should be ordered how they would normally be ordered in the original. So choruses need to be placed between verses and so on.
- Only the verses that are normally sung should be included in the Main arrangement.
- Additional variations that are normally not in the song should not be in the Main arrangement but should have a different arrangement for them. Such as `w/English` or `w/Russian`.
- If a verse or Chorus repeats it should be put into the arrangement twice.
- If part of a verse or chorus repeats the repeated section should have its own slide. So that will need to be put into the `Master` arrangement.

#### Arrangement Naming Scheme
- `Master` - This is the main song with all the songs unique component. Basically the un-arranged version
- `Main` - Arrangement that resembles the original song as possible and is mainly used.
- `w/Russian` - English Arrangement that includes some Russian components.
- `w/English` - Russian Arrangement that includes some English components.
